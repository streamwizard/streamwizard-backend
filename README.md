# StreamWizard Backend Tools

StreamWizard.org is the ultimate toolkit for Twitch broadcasters, designed to enhance stream interactivity, automate content creation, and provide deep analytics. This repository contains the core backend infrastructure that powers the StreamWizard ecosystem.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository houses the core backend services and shared logic for Twitch integrations. It's built as a monorepo using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

### Core Features

- **Twitch EventSub Management**: Robust handling of real-time Twitch events (follows, subs, raids).
- **VOD & Clip Management**: Automated synchronization and organization of Twitch content.
- **Interactive SMP Bridge**: Real-time integration between Twitch events and Minecraft servers.
- **Shared Architecture**: Centralized types, configurations, and API clients used across all StreamWizard services.
